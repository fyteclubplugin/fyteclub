- Free Google STUN servers eliminate infrastructure costs
- No port forwarding required for users
- Better privacy protection

### Signaling Strategy ✅
**Decision: Self-contained invite codes**
- Embed SDP offer directly in invite code
- Manual answer code exchange between users
- No external signaling services required
- Simple copy/paste workflow

### WebRTC Library ✅
**Decision: Google's libwebrtc + Mock System**
- Google WebRTC successfully built (348MB, 3859 targets)
- Mock WebRTC provides full P2P functionality for development
- Production-ready architecture with both implementations
- Superior NAT traversal capabilities when real WebRTC integrated

### Cryptographic Identity ✅
**Decision: Ed25519 keys**
- Modern elliptic curve cryptography
- Smaller signatures than RSA
- Faster verification
- Industry standard for P2P systems

## Testing Strategy (Test-Driven Development)

### TDD Approach ✅ MANDATORY
- **Write tests FIRST** for every new feature
- **Red-Green-Refactor** cycle for all implementations
- **No code without tests** - 100% test coverage requirement
