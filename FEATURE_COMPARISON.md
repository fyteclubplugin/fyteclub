# FyteClub Feature Specification: Complete FFXIV Mod Sync System

## Core Philosophy: Set and Forget

FyteClub is designed to be **fully automatic** - once configured, it syncs mods in the background whenever anyone in your server comes in contact with anyone else. No manual intervention required.

## Core Mod Synchronization Features

- **Automatic mod switching** - When players enter/leave range
- **Zone awareness** - Different mod sets per territory

## Additional Features FyteClub Should Have

### **Priority Features to Add**

#### **1. Player Filtering (High Priority)**
```csharp
// Essential for larger FCs - filter out players with mods you hate
private bool ShouldSyncWithPlayer(PlayerCharacter player)
{
    // Blacklist check - most important feature
    if (IsBlacklisted(player)) return false;
    
    // Friend list integration
    if (settings.OnlyFriends && !IsFriend(player)) return false;
    
    // Free Company members only
    if (settings.OnlyFC && !IsFCMember(player)) return false;
    
    return true;
}
```

#### **2. Admin Permissions (Medium Priority)**
```csharp
public class ServerPermissions
{
    public List<string> AdminUsers { get; set; } = new();
    public bool AllowUserBlacklists { get; set; } = true;
    public bool RequireAdminApproval { get; set; } = false;
}
```

#### **3. Simple Connection Status (Low Priority)**
```csharp
public class ServerStatus
{
    public int ConnectedUsers { get; set; }
    public DateTime ServerStartTime { get; set; }
    public string ServerName { get; set; } = "";
}
```

#### **4. Mod Conflict Resolution (Built-in)**
```csharp
// Already handled - each player shows whatever they have on
// No conflict resolution needed - just display their mods
private async Task ApplyPlayerMods(string playerId, string playerName, List<string> mods)
{
    // Each player gets their own collection, no conflicts
    var collectionName = $"FyteClub_{playerId}";
    // Apply their mods to their character only
}
```
