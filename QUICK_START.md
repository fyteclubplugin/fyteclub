# QUICK START

1. Download FyteClub-Plugin.zip
2. Extract to `%APPDATA%\XIVLauncher\installedPlugins\FyteClub\latest\`
3. Restart FFXIV
4. In-game: `/fyteclub` → create syncshell → generate invite code → send to friends
5. Friends join with invite code. No server setup required. If they can’t figure it out, that’s on them.
6. Mods sync automatically when you’re near other members (50m). Uses encrypted WebRTC channels. If it’s not working, check your range, check your config, or just try again.

## How it works
- Each syncshell is a group. Invite codes let friends join. No server, no nonsense.
- Membership is managed by tokens. Tokens are signed and stored locally. Lose your token, you’re out.
- Phonebook tracks group members. Host rotates if needed. No drama.
- All mod data is encrypted end-to-end. If you want plaintext, look elsewhere.

## Troubleshooting
- Plugin won’t load? Update XIVLauncher/Dalamud, check folder, restart game.
- Can’t connect? Double-check invite code, make sure everyone is online, stand closer.
- Mods not syncing? Enable syncing, restart plugin, check your range.
