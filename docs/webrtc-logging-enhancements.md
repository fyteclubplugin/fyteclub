# WebRTC Logging and Bootstrapping Enhancements

## Overview
Enhanced the robust WebRTC implementation with comprehensive logging and explicit bootstrapping to diagnose and fix data channel connection issues that were preventing mod syncing and phonebook bootstrapping.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Comprehensive Logging
- **Data Channel Lifecycle**: Added detailed logging for data channel state changes, creation, and readiness
- **ICE State Tracking**: Enhanced ICE connection state logging with peer identification
- **Candidate Processing**: Added logging for ICE candidate collection and processing counts
- **Connection Validation**: Added logging for send operations with channel state validation

### 2. Explicit Bootstrapping
- **Bootstrap Trigger**: Added `TriggerBootstrap()` method that fires when data channel is ready
- **Bootstrap Message**: Sends initial test message to verify data channel functionality
- **State Tracking**: Prevents duplicate bootstrap attempts with `_bootstrapCompleted` flag
- **Event-Driven**: Uses `OnDataChannelReady` event to ensure proper timing

### 3. Enhanced State Management
- **Channel State Validation**: `SendDataAsync` now validates channel state before sending
- **Ready Event**: Added `OnDataChannelReady` event to Peer class for precise timing
- **Connection Monitoring**: Enhanced connection state monitoring with detailed logging

### 4. Timing Improvements
- **ICE Collection**: Increased ICE candidate collection time from 1s to 2s
- **Candidate Counting**: Added `GetCandidateCount()` method to track ICE candidates
- **Processing Logs**: Added logs for ICE candidate processing from invite/answer codes

## Files Modified

### RobustWebRTCConnection.cs
- Added bootstrap completion tracking
- Enhanced peer connection event handling
- Added explicit bootstrapping when data channel is ready
- Improved send data validation and logging

### Peer.cs
- Added `OnDataChannelReady` event
- Enhanced `SendDataAsync` with state validation and logging

### WebRTCManager.cs
- Added comprehensive data channel state change logging
- Enhanced ICE state change logging with peer context
- Improved remote data channel handling logs
- Added ICE candidate ready logging

### InviteCodeSignaling.cs
- Added `GetCandidateCount()` method for tracking
- Enhanced ICE candidate processing logs with counts

## New Test Helper

### WebRTCTestHelper.cs
- Created minimal connection test to verify WebRTC functionality
- Tests offer/answer flow, data channel opening, and message exchange
- Provides isolated testing without mod sync complexity

## Expected Behavior

With these enhancements, the logs should now clearly show:

1. **Offer Creation**: ICE candidate collection count and timing
2. **Answer Processing**: ICE candidate processing from invite codes
3. **Data Channel States**: Detailed state transitions (Connecting â†’ Open)
4. **Bootstrap Trigger**: When mod sync bootstrap is initiated
5. **Send Operations**: Success/failure of data sending with reasons

## Debugging Strategy

1. **Check ICE Candidates**: Verify both sides collect and process ICE candidates
2. **Monitor Data Channel**: Ensure data channel reaches "Open" state on both sides
3. **Verify Bootstrap**: Confirm bootstrap message is sent and received
4. **Validate Timing**: Check if timing issues cause missed events

## Next Steps

1. Test with updated logging to identify exact failure point
2. Use WebRTCTestHelper for isolated connection testing
3. Verify data channel opens on both host and joiner sides
4. Confirm mod sync bootstrap triggers when channel is ready

The enhanced logging will provide clear visibility into the WebRTC connection lifecycle and help identify why mod syncing and phonebook bootstrapping were not working previously.
