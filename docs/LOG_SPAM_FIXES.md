# Log Spam Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. SecureLogger Filtering
- **File**: `SecureLogger.cs`
- **Fix**: Added filter to skip ðŸ“¨ðŸ“¨ðŸ“¨ and "received mod data from syncshell" messages in `LogInfo()`

### 2. WebRTC Buffering Spam
- **File**: `RobustWebRTCConnection.cs` 
- **Fix**: Removed buffering change logging and message received logging

### 3. Progressive Transfer Progress Spam
- **File**: `ProgressiveFileTransfer.cs`
- **Fix**: Suppressed progress logging during file transfers (both sent and received)

## Result
These changes will dramatically reduce log spam during file transfers by:
- Filtering out ðŸ“¨ðŸ“¨ðŸ“¨ emoji spam at the SecureLogger level
- Removing WebRTC buffering change notifications
- Suppressing progress percentage updates during transfers

The logs will now only show important events like transfer start/completion and errors, making them much more manageable during P2P mod sync operations.
