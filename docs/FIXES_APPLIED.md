# FyteClub Mod Application Fixes

## Issues Identified

Based on the log analysis, the following issues were identified:

1. **"CHAOS BYPASS" behavior**: Excessive logging with "ðŸ˜ˆ [CHAOS BYPASS]" messages indicating forced mod applications
2. **Task cancellation errors**: "Failed to apply Glamourer data: A task was canceled" errors
3. **Excessive mod applications**: Same characters getting mods applied multiple times rapidly (Triple Triad Trader, Roland)
4. **Disabled rate limiting**: Skip logic was temporarily disabled for debugging, causing spam

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed CHAOS BYPASS Methods
- **Removed**: `ForceApplyPlayerModsBypassCollections` method
- **Removed**: `ApplyAdvancedPlayerInfoForced` method  
- **Removed**: `ApplyPenumbraModsForced` method
- **Replaced with**: `ApplyPlayerModsEnhanced` method with proper rate limiting

### 2. Added Proper Cancellation Token Handling
- **Added**: Timeout-based cancellation tokens (10-15 seconds) to prevent hanging
- **Added**: Proper `OperationCanceledException` handling in all mod application methods
- **Fixed**: `ApplyGlamourerData`, `ApplyCustomizePlusData`, `ApplyPenumbraMods` now use cancellation tokens

### 3. Re-enabled Rate Limiting
- **Fixed**: Re-enabled the `ShouldSkipApplication` logic that was disabled for debugging
- **Increased**: Minimum reapplication interval from 30 seconds to 2 minutes
- **Added**: Better logging for skip decisions

### 4. Improved Penumbra Collection Handling
- **Changed**: `forceAssignment: false` instead of `true` to respect user's collection settings
- **Added**: Better error logging for collection creation and assignment failures
- **Improved**: Validation and error handling in mod parsing

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Added**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with specific error messages
- **Added**: Timeout handling for semaphore waits
- **Improved**: Logging to distinguish between different failure modes

## Code Changes Made

### FyteClubModIntegration.cs
1. **Line ~1200**: Re-enabled skip logic in `ApplyPlayerMods`
2. **Line ~1300**: Added cancellation token handling to `ApplyGlamourerData`
3. **Line ~1400**: Added cancellation token handling to `ApplyCustomizePlusData`
4. **Line ~1500**: Added cancellation token handling to `ApplyPenumbraMods`
5. **Line ~1600**: Removed all "CHAOS BYPASS" methods
6. **Line ~50**: Increased rate limiting interval to 2 minutes

## Expected Results

After these fixes:
- âœ… No more "CHAOS BYPASS" logging spam
- âœ… No more task cancellation errors
- âœ… Reduced excessive mod applications through proper rate limiting
- âœ… Better stability with timeout handling
- âœ… Respects user's Penumbra collection settings

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Monitor logs** for reduction in mod application frequency
2. **Check** that characters don't get mods applied multiple times rapidly
3. **Verify** that Glamourer applications complete without cancellation errors
4. **Test** that mod applications still work correctly but with proper rate limiting

## Additional Notes

- The fixes maintain all existing functionality while adding proper safeguards
- Rate limiting can be adjusted if 2 minutes proves too restrictive
- Cancellation timeouts can be adjusted based on performance needs
- All changes are backward compatible with existing P2P protocol
