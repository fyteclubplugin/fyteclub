# WebRTC Bootstrap and Async Warning Fixes

## Problem Identified
The async warnings indicated that our WebRTC implementation wasn't actually doing meaningful work when data channels opened. The methods were marked async but didn't await anything, suggesting missing functionality.

## Root Cause
The WebRTC implementation had proper connection establishment but lacked:
1. **Actual bootstrapping logic** when data channels opened
2. **Proper async/await patterns** for methods that didn't need to be async
3. **Meaningful actions** when connections were established

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Bootstrap Logic Enhancement
- **TriggerBootstrap()**: Made properly async to await SendDataAsync
- **Bootstrap Message**: Sends actual test message when data channel opens
- **State Tracking**: Prevents duplicate bootstrap attempts

### 2. Async Pattern Cleanup
- **InitializeAsync()**: Removed async since no await operations
- **SendDataAsync()**: Removed async from Peer class (synchronous operation)
- **SetRemoteAnswerAsync()**: Removed async since no await operations

### 3. Proper Event Handling
- **OnDataChannelReady**: Added event to trigger bootstrap at correct timing
- **State Validation**: Added channel state checks before sending data
- **Error Logging**: Enhanced logging for failed send operations

## Key Changes

### RobustWebRTCConnection.cs
```csharp
// Now properly awaits the send operation
private async void TriggerBootstrap()
{
    if (_bootstrapCompleted) return;
    
    _pluginLog?.Info("[WebRTC] Data channel ready - triggering mod sync bootstrap");
    _bootstrapCompleted = true;
    
    // Send initial bootstrap message
    var bootstrapMsg = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("{\"type\":\"bootstrap\",\"message\":\"ready\"}");
    await SendDataAsync(bootstrapMsg);
}

// Removed unnecessary async
public Task<bool> InitializeAsync()
{
    // ... initialization logic
    return Task.FromResult(true);
}
```

### Peer.cs
```csharp
// Removed async since SendMessage is synchronous
public Task SendDataAsync(byte[] data)
{
    if (DataChannel?.State == Microsoft.MixedReality.WebRTC.DataChannel.ChannelState.Open)
    {
        DataChannel.SendMessage(data);
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"[WebRTC] Cannot send data for {PeerId} - channel state: {DataChannel?.State}");
    }
    return Task.CompletedTask;
}
```

## Expected Behavior Now

1. **Connection Establishment**: WebRTC connections establish with proper ICE exchange
2. **Data Channel Opening**: When channel opens, bootstrap is triggered
3. **Bootstrap Message**: Test message is sent to verify channel functionality
4. **Mod Sync Ready**: Channel is ready for actual mod data exchange
5. **Proper Logging**: All states and transitions are logged for debugging

## Testing Strategy

1. **Use WebRTCTestHelper**: Test minimal connection without mod sync complexity
2. **Monitor Logs**: Look for bootstrap trigger and test message exchange
3. **Verify Channel States**: Ensure data channels reach "Open" state
4. **Check Message Flow**: Confirm bootstrap messages are sent and received

## Next Steps

1. Test the enhanced implementation with detailed logging
2. Verify bootstrap messages are exchanged between peers
3. Confirm mod sync can build on top of working data channels
4. Use the test helper to isolate WebRTC functionality

The async warnings were actually highlighting that we weren't doing the real work needed when data channels opened. Now the implementation properly bootstraps mod sync when connections are ready.
