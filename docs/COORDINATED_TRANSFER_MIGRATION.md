# üéØ Coordinated Transfer System Migration Guide

## Overview

The new **Coordinated Transfer System** replaces the old load balancing approach with:

1. **üìã Manifest Exchange** - Both sides agree on exactly what files go where
2. **üéØ File Contracts** - Each channel has a specific assignment 
3. **üìÑ Completion Receipts** - Every file completion is acknowledged
4. **üôå Channel High Fives** - Coordinated channel closure when both sides are done

## Key Benefits

### ‚úÖ **Eliminates Duplicate Assignments**
- **Old System**: Same mods duplicated across all 20 channels = 426MB total transfers
- **New System**: 96MB distributed once across channels = 96MB total transfers

### ‚úÖ **Perfect File Tracking**
- Every file is assigned to exactly one channel
- Both sides know what to expect on each channel
- Receipts confirm successful delivery
- No guesswork or race conditions

### ‚úÖ **Coordinated Completion**
- Channels close only when both sides confirm completion
- No orphaned channels or resource leaks
- Clean shutdown with mutual acknowledgment

## Migration Steps

### 1. Replace `SendFilesMultiChannel` calls

**Before (Old System):**
```csharp
await orchestrator.SendFilesMultiChannel(files, channelCount, multiChannelSend);
```

**After (New System):**
```csharp
await orchestrator.SendFilesCoordinated(peerId, files, channelCount, multiChannelSend);
```

### 2. Add Protocol Message Handling

You need to handle the new coordination messages:

```csharp
public class YourWebRTCHandler
{
    private readonly CoordinatedTransferExample _coordinatedTransfer;

    public async Task OnMessageReceived(byte[] messageData, int channelId)
    {
        // Check if this is a coordination message
        if (IsCoordinationMessage(messageData))
        {
            await _coordinatedTransfer.ProcessIncomingMessage(messageData);
            return;
        }

        // Handle regular file chunk messages
        await HandleFileChunk(messageData, channelId);
    }
}
```

### 3. Update Channel Management

**Before:**
```csharp
// Channels closed arbitrarily when buffers empty
if (bufferEmpty) CloseChannel(channelId);
```

**After:**
```csharp
// Channels closed only after mutual high five
_coordinatedTransfer.OnChannelCompleted += (channelId) => 
{
    CloseChannel(channelId); // Both sides confirmed done
};
```

## Message Flow Example

### Phase 1: Manifest Exchange
```
Host ‚Üí Joiner: "I'm sending you these files on these channels"
Joiner ‚Üí Host: "I'm sending you these files on these channels"
```

### Phase 2: Coordinated Transfer
```
Channel 0: Host sends ModA.ttmp2, Joiner sends ModX.ttmp2
Channel 1: Host sends ModB.ttmp2, Joiner sends ModY.ttmp2
Channel 2: Host sends ModC.ttmp2, Joiner sends ModZ.ttmp2
...
```

### Phase 3: Completion Coordination
```
Channel 0: Both sides done ‚Üí High Five ‚Üí Close Channel
Channel 1: Both sides done ‚Üí High Five ‚Üí Close Channel
Channel 2: Both sides done ‚Üí High Five ‚Üí Close Channel
...
```

## Expected Results

### üöÄ **Performance Improvements**
- **4x Less Data**: 96MB instead of 426MB total transfers
- **No Buffer Saturation**: Each file sent exactly once
- **Better Load Distribution**: Large files balanced across channels

### üõ°Ô∏è **Reliability Improvements**
- **No Concurrent Collection Errors**: Fixed with thread-safe tracking
- **No Channel Index Mismatches**: Physical-to-logical mapping
- **Guaranteed Completion**: Mutual acknowledgment system

### üìä **Visibility Improvements**
- **Real Progress Tracking**: Know exactly what's happening on each channel
- **Error Detection**: Know immediately if something goes wrong
- **Debug Information**: Complete transfer audit trail

## Testing the Migration

1. **Enable Debug Logging**: You'll see detailed coordination messages
2. **Monitor Channel Usage**: Each channel should have unique files
3. **Verify Completion**: All channels should close cleanly
4. **Check Total Data**: Should match actual mod collection size

## Backwards Compatibility

The new system is **additive**:
- Old `SendFilesMultiChannel` still works for compatibility
- New `SendFilesCoordinated` provides the enhanced experience
- Migration can be gradual or immediate

## Example Implementation

See `CoordinatedTransferExample.cs` for a complete working example showing:
- How to start coordinated transfers
- How to handle incoming coordination messages
- How to track progress and completion
- How to integrate with existing WebRTC code

The coordinated system turns your multi-channel transfers from a "spray and pray" approach into a **precision-guided** operation where every file has a purpose and destination!
