# WebRTC Peer-to-Peer Architecture for FyteClub

## Overview

This document outlines the transition from FyteClub's current server-based architecture to a peer-to-peer (P2P) system using WebRTC. The goal is to eliminate server dependencies for mod sharing while maintaining functionality.

## Current Architecture vs P2P

### Current (Server-Based)
```
Plugin A → HTTP → Server → HTTP → Plugin B
```

### Proposed (P2P)
```
Plugin A ←→ WebRTC ←→ Plugin B
```

## WebRTC Fundamentals

WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) enables direct peer-to-peer connections between clients. Key components:

- **RTCPeerConnection**: Manages the connection between peers
- **RTCDataChannel**: Sends arbitrary data between peers (used for mod transfers)
- **ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment)**: Handles NAT traversal and connection establishment
- **STUN/TURN servers**: Assist with NAT traversal (minimal server dependency)

## Benefits

### Eliminated Dependencies
- No server hosting costs or maintenance
- No single point of failure
- No bandwidth limitations from server capacity
- No data storage requirements

### Performance Improvements
- Direct connections reduce latency
- No server bottleneck for large mod transfers
- Bandwidth scales with number of users

### Privacy Enhancement
- Mod data never touches third-party servers
- Direct encrypted peer connections
- No centralized data collection

## Downsides

### Technical Complexity
- WebRTC implementation is significantly more complex than HTTP
- NAT traversal failures require fallback mechanisms
- Connection state management across multiple peers

### Network Limitations
- Requires STUN servers for initial connection establishment
- Some corporate firewalls block WebRTC traffic
- Symmetric NATs may prevent direct connections

### Discovery Challenges
- No central registry of online users
- Requires alternative peer discovery mechanism
- Harder to implement friend lists and groups

## Responsibility Migration

### From Server to Client

**Peer Discovery**
- Current: Server maintains list of connected users
- P2P: Clients must discover each other via broadcast or rendezvous

**Mod Storage**
- Current: Server stores and serves mod data
- P2P: Each client maintains own mod cache and serves to peers

**Connection Management**
- Current: Server handles all client connections
- P2P: Each client manages multiple peer connections

**Authentication/Authorization**
- Current: Server validates user permissions
- P2P: Clients must implement trust mechanisms

### Retained Server Functions (Optional)

**Signaling Server**
- Minimal server for WebRTC connection establishment
- Only handles initial handshake, not data transfer
- Can be replaced with alternative discovery methods

**STUN Server**
- Required for NAT traversal
- Lightweight, can use public STUN servers
- No user data processed

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: WebRTC Integration
- Add WebRTC libraries to plugin
- Implement basic peer connection establishment
- Create data channel for mod transfers

### Phase 2: Peer Discovery
- Implement local network broadcast for peer discovery
- Add manual peer connection via IP address
- Maintain compatibility with existing server-based discovery

### Phase 3: Server Elimination
- Remove HTTP-based mod transfer
- Implement distributed peer registry
- Add fallback mechanisms for connection failures

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Implement peer reputation system
- Add support for peer groups/rooms
- Optimize connection management for large groups

## Technical Considerations

### NAT Traversal
- Approximately 80% of connections succeed with STUN alone
- TURN servers required for remaining 20% (adds server dependency)
- Implement connection quality detection and fallbacks

### Data Transfer
- WebRTC data channels support binary data transfer
- Built-in congestion control and reliability
- Maximum message size limitations require chunking for large mods

### Security
- WebRTC provides built-in encryption (DTLS)
- Peer authentication requires additional implementation
- Consider certificate-based trust or shared secrets

### Scalability
- Each client can maintain connections to multiple peers
- Connection overhead grows with group size
- Consider mesh vs star topology for large groups

## Migration Strategy

### Hybrid Approach
Maintain server-based functionality while adding P2P capabilities:

1. Add WebRTC as alternative transport
2. Use server for peer discovery initially
3. Gradually migrate features to P2P
4. Provide server fallback for connection failures

### Compatibility
- Maintain existing HTTP API during transition
- Allow mixed server/P2P deployments
- Provide configuration options for deployment scenarios

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- WebRTC connection failures in restrictive networks
- Increased complexity may introduce bugs
- Peer discovery reliability in various network configurations

### Medium Risk
- Performance degradation with many simultaneous connections
- Battery usage increase on mobile devices
- Debugging distributed connection issues

### Low Risk
- STUN server availability (many public options)
- WebRTC browser compatibility (well-established)

## Success Metrics

- Connection establishment success rate >90%
- Mod transfer speed equivalent or better than server-based
- Reduced infrastructure costs to zero
- Maintained feature parity with server-based version

## Conclusion

WebRTC P2P architecture offers significant benefits in terms of cost, performance, and privacy, but introduces complexity in connection management and peer discovery. A phased migration approach with hybrid functionality provides the safest path to full P2P implementation.
