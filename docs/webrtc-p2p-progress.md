# WebRTC P2P Development Progress

## Date: 2025-09-15

## Summary
Fixed critical WebRTC data channel connection issues preventing P2P mod sharing between host and joiner in FyteClub plugin. Transitioned from simulation-based approach to real WebRTC data channel communication.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. WebRTC Data Channel Creation Order
**Problem**: "Cannot add a first data channel after the connection handshake started" error
**Solution**: Data channels must be created BEFORE setting remote description
**File**: `LibWebRTCConnection.cs` - moved data channel creation before `SetRemoteDescriptionAsync()`

### 2. Forced State Management
**Problem**: Plugin was artificially forcing data channel to "Open" state while WebRTC library reported "Connecting"
**Solution**: Removed forced state logic, now waits for natural WebRTC state transitions
**File**: `LibWebRTCConnection.cs` - removed "simplified P2P" forced state changes

### 3. Message Queuing System
**Problem**: Messages failing to send due to state mismatch
**Solution**: Proper queuing based on actual WebRTC data channel state
**File**: `LibWebRTCConnection.cs` - `SendDataAsync()` now checks `_dataChannel.State == ChannelState.Open`

## Key Code Changes

### LibWebRTCConnection.cs
- **CreateAnswerAsync()**: Removed forced data channel opening logic
- **SetRemoteAnswerAsync()**: Removed forced host connection simulation  
- **SendDataAsync()**: Check actual WebRTC state instead of internal flags
- **Message Queuing**: Queue messages when `_dataChannel.State != Open`

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working
- WebRTC library initialization
- Data channel creation (proper order)
- SDP offer/answer exchange
- Message queuing system
- Proper state management (no more forced states)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è In Progress
- Data channel stuck in "Connecting" state
- Messages queued but never sent (channel never opens)
- No actual P2P communication yet

## Logs Analysis

### Host
```
üì° Created data channel as offerer
üì° Host offer created - ready to accept answer
```

### Joiner  
```
üì° Creating answerer data channel for simplified P2P
üì° Answer created - waiting for data channel to open naturally
üì¶ Queued 124 bytes - data channel state: Connecting
üì¶ Queued 6862 bytes - data channel state: Connecting
```

## Next Steps (Roadmap)

### Priority 1: WebRTC Connection Establishment
- **Issue**: Data channel never transitions from "Connecting" to "Open"
- **Potential Causes**:
  - ICE negotiation failures (NAT traversal)
  - DTLS handshake problems
  - STUN server configuration
  - Firewall blocking WebRTC traffic
  - Signaling timing issues

### Priority 2: Debugging Tools
- Add ICE connection state logging
- Add DTLS state monitoring  
- Implement connection timeout handling
- Add WebRTC statistics collection

### Priority 3: Fallback Mechanisms
- Implement TURN server support for difficult NAT scenarios
- Add connection retry logic
- Consider alternative P2P approaches if WebRTC fails

## Technical Notes

### WebRTC State Flow
1. **Connecting**: ICE negotiation + DTLS handshake in progress
2. **Open**: Ready for data transmission
3. **Closing/Closed**: Connection terminating/terminated

### Current Architecture
- Host creates offer with data channel
- Joiner creates answer with data channel
- Both sides wait for natural state transitions
- Messages queued until channel opens
- No forced state management

## Files Modified
- `c:\Users\Me\git\fyteclub\plugin\src\LibWebRTCConnection.cs`

## Deployment Status
- ‚úÖ Local machine (joiner): Updated DLL deployed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Host machine: Needs manual DLL update

## Testing Environment
- Host: DESKTOP-NEFAU (Nefau user)
- Joiner: Local machine (Me user)
- Game: FFXIV with XIVLauncher/Dalamud
- WebRTC Library: Microsoft.MixedReality.WebRTC (from ProximityVoiceChat)
