Implement real, production-ready code and concrete steps only. If you believe the current approach, language, or stack is sub-optimal, stop immediately and explain the alternative, its benefits, and exactly how to switch; otherwise implement directly without delay. Never hallucinate or guess—if unsure, state uncertainty and request clarification or perform only a targeted lookup. Do not leave mocks, scaffolds, or stubs except inside explicit unit tests. Minimize external calls and tool usage; every lookup or action must have a clear purpose and high likelihood of success. Fail fast is acceptable, but avoid speculative tangents. Provide commands and file changes in ready-to-copy form. When in doubt about specific mod application, Penumbra or Glamourer API integration, or game-specific mod data parsing or edge cases, consult the MareClient and LightlessSync repositories—already cloned into this repo—for proven implementation patterns.
