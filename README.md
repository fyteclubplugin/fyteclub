## What It Does

FyteClub solves the problem of manually sharing FFXIV character mods by automatically synchronizing them when players encounter each other in-game. Unlike other solutions, FyteClub provides enterprise-grade encryption, zero-knowledge privacy, and complete self-hosting control.

### Key Features

- **End-to-End Encryption** - RSA + AES hybrid encryption protects all mod data
- **Zero-Knowledge Privacy** - Server never sees actual mod content, only encrypted data
- **Proximity-Based Sync** - Automatically detects nearby players (50-meter range)
- **Complete Plugin Integration** - Works with Penumbra, Glamourer, Customize+, SimpleHeels, and Honorific
- **Server Switching** - Save and switch between multiple friend servers instantly
- **Direct Connection** - Connect directly to friend's server IP address
- **Paid Mod Protection** - Cryptographic ownership proofs protect creator income
- **100% Self-Hosted** - No central servers, you control everything
- **XIVLauncher Ready** - Distributes through trusted plugin repository

### How It Works

1. **Friend hosts server** - One person runs `fyteclub-server`
2. **Share the address** - Host tells friends their IP: "Connect to 192.168.1.100:3000"
3. **Friends connect** - Everyone connects with `fyteclub connect 192.168.1.100:3000`
4. **Play together** - Plugin auto-starts daemon, mods sync automatically
5. **Multiple groups** - Each friend group runs their own server
6. **Stay private** - Fully decentralized, direct peer-to-peer connections

## The Problem We Solve

**For Privacy-Conscious Users**: "I want to share mods with friends, but I don't want servers spying on my mod collection."

**For Mod Creators**: "People are sharing my paid mods freely, and I'm losing income from my work."

**For Friend Groups**: "We want automatic mod sharing, but existing solutions are insecure or keep shutting down."

**For Self-Hosters**: "I want complete control over my data with zero dependence on external services or companies."

## Architecture

FyteClub uses a modular, security-first architecture:

### **FFXIV Plugin (Dalamud)**
- **Player Detection** - Safe ObjectTable scanning (50m range)
- **Penumbra Integration** - Mod management via IPC
- **Glamourer Integration** - Character appearance sync
- **Encryption** - End-to-end encrypted mod transfers

### **Client Application (Node.js)**
- **Server Management** - Connect to multiple servers by IP address
- **Cryptography** - RSA key generation and AES encryption
- **IPC Communication** - Named pipes with FFXIV plugin

## Project Status

ðŸŽ† **Core Complete** - Plugin + Encryption + Server Management Ready

### **âœ… Complete and Working (100%)**
