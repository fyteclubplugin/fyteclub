# FyteClub Architecture Guide v3.0

## 🏗️ **System Overview**

FyteClub uses a **2-tier architecture** with direct communication and intelligent caching:

```
FFXIV Plugin ↔ HTTP API ↔ FyteClub Server
     │                         │
  Detects players         Encrypted storage
  Applies mods           Zero-knowledge
```

---

## 🔌 **Component 1: FFXIV Plugin (C#)**

### **Core Functions:**
- **Player Detection**: Scans 50m radius every 3 seconds using ObjectTable
- **Movement Filtering**: Only processes players who moved >5 meters
- **Mod Application**: Integrates with Penumbra, Glamourer, Customize+, SimpleHeels, Honorific
- **Auto-Resync**: Uploads mods on login, zone change, and character modifications

### **Communication:**
- **To Server**: Direct HTTP API calls (no daemon)
- **Real-time**: HTTP requests for nearby players and mod retrieval
- **Batch Data**: Sends player mod data for server storage

### **Key Features:**
```csharp
// Smart player detection with position tracking
var positions = players.Select(p => new { 
    x = p.Position.X, y = p.Position.Y, z = p.Position.Z 
}).ToArray();

// Direct HTTP call to server
await httpClient.PostAsync($"http://{server.Address}/api/register-mods", content);
```

### **Commands:**
- `/fyteclub` - Open server management UI
- `/fyteclub resync` - Force upload current mods

---

## ⚡ **Component 2: FyteClub Server (Node.js)**

### **Core Functions:**
- **HTTP API Server**: Direct endpoints for plugin communication  
- **Mod Storage**: Deduplicated storage with optimal space usage
- **Player Management**: Registration and mod association tracking
- **Real-time Processing**: Instant mod retrieval and updates

### **API Endpoints:**
```javascript
POST /api/register-mods    // Upload player mods
GET  /api/mods/:playerId   // Retrieve player mods
POST /api/players/register // Register new player
GET  /api/stats           // Server statistics
GET  /logs               // Web-based log viewer
```

### **Storage Architecture:**
```
server/optimal-storage/
├── content/     # Deduplicated mod files
├── configs/     # Individual player configurations  
└── manifests/   # Player mod associations
```

### **Performance Features:**
- **Deduplication**: Single storage of popular mods (99%+ space savings)
- **Configuration Preservation**: Individual player settings maintained
- **Smart Caching**: 5-minute cache for frequent requests
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes stale data after 24 hours

## 🔄 **Complete Workflow**

### **1. Server Startup**
```
┌─ Start Node.js HTTP server on configured port
├─ Initialize optimal deduplication storage
├─ Load log management with web viewer
└─ Server ready for plugin connections
```

### **2. Plugin Connection**
```
┌─ Plugin reads server list from configuration
├─ Tests HTTP connectivity to each server
├─ Displays connection status in UI
└─ Ready for mod synchronization
```

### **3. Real-time Mod Sync**
```
Every 3 seconds:
┌─ Plugin detects nearby players (50m radius)
├─ Filter players who moved >5 meters
├─ Send HTTP requests to server for each player
├─ Server returns encrypted mods from optimal storage
├─ Plugin applies mods to characters instantly
└─ No local storage - mods applied directly from memory
```

### **4. Character Changes**
```
When you change appearance:
┌─ Plugin detects login/zone change/mod update
├─ Collect current mods from all plugins
├─ Encrypt mod data with character-specific key
├─ Send HTTP POST to all connected servers
├─ Server stores with deduplication and config separation
└─ Your new look is queued for instant retrieval
```
```

## 🚀 **Performance Features**

### **Speed Optimizations:**
- **Direct HTTP**: No intermediate daemon overhead
- **Optimal Deduplication**: 99%+ space savings on popular mods
- **Smart Caching**: 5-minute cache for frequent requests  
- **Configuration Separation**: Instant mod+config reconstruction
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes stale data after 24 hours

### **Storage Benefits:**
- **Space Efficient**: Popular 2GB mod shared by 10 players = 2GB total (not 20GB)
- **Config Preservation**: Each player keeps individual mod settings
- **Fast Retrieval**: Pre-packaged mod+config combinations
- **Maintenance**: Automated cleanup of unreferenced content

### **Security Features:**
- **Zero-Knowledge**: Server cannot decrypt mod content
- **Character-Specific**: Each player's data encrypted with unique keys
- **Isolated Storage**: Mod content separate from personal configurations
- **Access Control**: Players only access their own data

### **Smart Filtering:**
- **5-Meter Threshold**: Only check players who actually moved
- **Position Tracking**: Remember last known positions
- **Cache Hits**: Skip server requests for recently seen players

### **Network Efficiency:**
- **Before**: Individual request per player every 3s = 20+ requests/minute
- **After**: Batch request for moved players only = 1-3 requests/minute
- **Improvement**: **90%+ reduction** in network traffic

## 🔐 **Security Architecture**

### **End-to-End Encryption:**
1. **Plugin**: Encrypts mods with `FyteClubSecurity.EncryptForServer()`
2. **Daemon**: Passes encrypted data (never decrypts)
3. **Server**: Stores encrypted blobs (zero-knowledge)
4. **Retrieval**: Other players decrypt with your public key

### **Zero-Knowledge Server:**
- Server never sees actual mod content
- Only stores encrypted data + public keys
- Cannot decrypt or inspect your mods
- Complete privacy protection

## 🎯 **Key Improvements Across Versions**

| Feature | v1.0 | v2.0 | v3.0 |
|---------|------|------|------|
| **Communication** | HTTP polling | WebSocket real-time | Enhanced WebSocket + REST |
| **Requests** | Individual per player | Batch operations | Optimized batch + deduplication |
| **Filtering** | Check all players | Movement-based filtering | Smart filtering + caching |
| **Caching** | None | 5-minute memory cache | Redis + memory fallback |
| **Storage** | Basic file storage | Improved organization | SHA-256 deduplication |
| **Network Traffic** | High (20+ req/min) | Low (1-3 req/min) | Minimal (optimized) |
| **Response Time** | 3-5 seconds | Instant (<100ms) | Ultra-fast (<50ms) |
| **Hanging Issues** | Frequent timeouts | Eliminated | Eliminated |
| **Database** | Basic SQLite | Enhanced queries | Optimized with indexes |

---

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### **Connection Issues:**
- **Plugin**: Check WebSocket connection to `ws://localhost:8081`
- **Daemon**: Verify HTTP server on `localhost:8080`
- **Server**: Confirm friend's server is accessible

### **Performance Issues:**
- **High CPU**: Check movement filtering is working
- **Memory Usage**: Verify cache cleanup (5-minute expiry)
- **Network Spam**: Ensure batch operations are being used

### **Mod Sync Issues:**
- **Not Syncing**: Use `/fyteclub resync` to force upload
- **Outdated Mods**: Check cache expiry and deduplication status
- **Storage Issues**: Verify optimal deduplication is working
