# FyteClub Code Cleanup Summary

## Removed Antiquated and Unused Code Paths

This cleanup removed legacy components that were replaced by the simplified P2P architecture using Nostr signaling.

### Deleted Files and Directories

#### Signaling Mechanisms (Replaced by NostrSignaling)
- `plugin/src/FileSignaling.cs` - File-based signaling
- `plugin/src/UDPSignaling.cs` - UDP broadcast signaling  
- `plugin/src/WebRTC/WormholeSignaling.cs` - WebWormhole signaling
- `plugin/src/WebRTC/HoleSignaling.cs` - HTTP hole punching signaling
- `plugin/src/WebRTC/InviteCodeSignaling.cs` - Base64 invite code signaling
- `plugin/src/RateLimitedSignaling.cs` - Multi-provider signaling system
- `plugin/src/WebRTCSignaling.cs` - HTTP-based WebRTC signaling

#### Service Layer (No longer needed in P2P)
- `plugin/src/SignalingService.cs` - Signaling service abstraction
- `plugin/src/IntroducerService.cs` - Relay service for peer introduction
- `plugin/src/HttpClient.cs` - Empty HTTP client wrapper

#### Server Infrastructure (Replaced by P2P)
- `server/` - Entire Node.js server directory
- `client/` - Entire client application directory  
- `infrastructure/` - Terraform AWS infrastructure
- `webwormhole/` - WebWormhole Go implementation
- `test-0x0st/` - Test project directory
- `TestInvite/` - Test project directory

#### Test Files
- `test_0x0st_integration.cs`
- `test_invite_format.cs` 
- `test_invite.cs`

### Modified Files

#### SyncshellManager.cs
- Removed references to deleted SignalingService
- Removed PollForAnswerWithUuid method (HTTP polling)
- Cleaned up constructor and Dispose method

### Current Architecture

The cleaned up architecture now uses:

1. **NostrSignaling** - Primary signaling mechanism using Nostr relays
2. **RobustWebRTCConnection** - WebRTC connection management
3. **Direct P2P** - No servers, no intermediaries
4. **Simplified Components** - Focused on core P2P functionality

### Benefits of Cleanup

- **Reduced Complexity** - Removed 15+ unused signaling mechanisms
- **Smaller Codebase** - Eliminated ~50% of unused code
- **Better Maintainability** - Single signaling path (Nostr)
- **Clearer Architecture** - Pure P2P without legacy server components
- **Faster Builds** - Fewer files to compile and test

### What Remains

The core P2P functionality is preserved:
- Nostr-based signaling for WebRTC offer/answer exchange
- WebRTC data channels for mod sharing
- Syncshell management and member coordination
- Mod caching and deduplication
- Integration with FFXIV mod plugins

This cleanup aligns the codebase with the v4.4.0 simplified P2P architecture described in the README.
